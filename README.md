# AI-ML-Review-Predictor
A custom Bayes Classifier that can predict reviews with up to 95% accuracy.

This script will predict hotel reviews (and reviews in general) as positive or negative using natural language processing, Bayesian classification,
and other general Machine Learning techniques.

I've included two versions of this program, one that will predict individual reviews input by user, and one that will run each train/split %
and provide metrics.

This can be launched from a command line in this folder, or from the run scripts included. Python istall is required.
Required dependecies can be found in run script.

Inquiries and requests can be sent to camerongrande95@gmail.com.
